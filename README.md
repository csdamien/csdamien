- 👋 Hi, I’m @fridakitten
- 👀 I’m interested in coding useful open source tools. Open source because people can learn from my code, contribute or report bugs to me. :3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deeply computer science and the linux world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on other open source tools i can help.
- 📫 How to reach me: ceo@polcom.de or my twitter: https://x.com/SeanIsTethered
- 😄 Pronouns: she/he (gender fluid)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I made iOS's first open source and mostly full fledged IDE (After iTheosMaker, but my thing is a totally different thing).
